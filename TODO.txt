TODO:

- Import JSON data into database
	- Create models and corresponding fixture
		- Add elevation: elev_baro
	- May have to create mins and maxes fixtures separately
	- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/initial-data/ 
	- Make requests a query from this database
- Proper routing 
- Filtering by difference
- Refresh depending on map view
	- Filter in javascript and only make requests depending on map view from server
	- Or: make markers shown in a particular view deterministic
- Show graphs
- Create color layer interpolated between stations
	- Possibly more ambitious: model elevation differences via lapse rate:
		- Interpolation of elevation, temperature between stations: 
		http://wiki.scipy.org/Cookbook/Matplotlib/Gridding_irregularly_spaced_data
		- Sample elevation data and calculate temperature again, based on interpolated temperature and difference between interpolated and actual elevation

		- Interpolate temperature again
